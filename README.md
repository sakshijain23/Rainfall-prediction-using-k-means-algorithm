Using cloud cover percentage to predict rainfall
 Rainfall plays a vital role in balancing the Earth's ecosystem. Prediction of rainfall will act as a boon in the sustainability of the ecosystem. Production of crops is mainly dependent on the amount of rainfall they experience in a particular season. By studying cloud images, classification of rainy clouds can be accomplished. Depending on the amount of rainy clouds, a pattern can be established between the amount of heavy rainy clouds and rainfall in that particular country. Pre-knowledge of rainfall will contribute in the area of farming as well as prior preparedness from various disasters.
 
The past records of cloud images are analyzed and an interesting pattern is determined imparting a relationship between measure of rainy clouds and rainfall within a region. 

Satellite images are obtained from Nasa earth and rainfall data from Nasa energypower source. 
k-means clustering is used  to extract different percentages of cloud. The technique we will be applying to extract patterns is Neural Network. Neural Network is an algorithm that takes input data and output of the test data. Then it outputs rules or patterns, which will define the relationship and function between data. Utilizing these patterns, future prediction of rainfall is achievable.
